    <h3>Our Mission</h3>

    <p>PatchaTech was conceived as a capstone project by three students of DevPoint Labs. The idea was simple: create a website that fills the need for free, peer-submitted and reviewed tutorials that tackle common issues with today's modern devices. By making PatchaTech your go-to site for gaining new knowledge and skills, you'll end up saving a fistful of dollars (and more than a few head aches!) fixing your devices yourself.</p>

      <p>Since childhood, Landon has been a lover of art, music, and all things creative. His interest in graphic design really took off as a teenager when he found he could Photoshop himself into a picture with Britney Spears. Most recently, he attended DevPoint Labs, a web development boot camp, where the skills to build this website were crammed into his head over an eleven week period.

      <p>As a developer, designer, and dungeons and dragons player, some would call me a nerd. I attempt, however, to offset this with a love for the outdoors, recreation, and travel. Having years of on the side experience in the front end, I am well versed in HTML, CSS, JavaScript and jQuery. I have recently been attending classes learning ruby, rails, and back end development.</p>

      <p>Ever since highschool I have been intrigued by computer science. Since then, I have also been learning Photography in my spare time and pursuing a associates degree in Computer Science. Most recently, I decided to take another route and learn web development from a school known as DevPoint Labs. At this school I was able to learn the fundamentals of full-stack development and I'm loving it.</p>
